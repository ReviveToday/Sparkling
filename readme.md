# Sparkling (subject to change)
Fork of ColourLib's Sparkling theme, with bespoke modifications for [ReviveToday](https://revive.today) use. Please do check 
their version out instead of this fork, as this is the version that is on the WordPress theme directory.

# Slider modifications
Slider uses WordPress CPT in-built custom fields, which can be a bit hap-hazard. The following fields are _actually_ supported.
* description
* url

Slider uses the custom post type `sp_rt_featslider`.

# Credits
